# DMN / DRD implementation dojo

This project has been subject during a LV 1871 coding dojo.

It implements a rest based micro-service utilizing DMN decision tables and an embedded camunda process engine to provide a decision service.

It also shows how to unit-test decision tables and even complete decision requirement diagrams.
